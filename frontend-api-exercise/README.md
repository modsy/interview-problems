Below is an exercise to be completed before your interview using whatever
resources you would like (e.g. codepen, github, etc.). Plan on spending at least
two hours on the exercise.

In your interview you will discuss your solution and your process.

The solution:

- should run with no errors (feel free to use any linting rules you prefer)
- should be formatted and legible
- should be well commented
- the rendered elements should look professional
- will use modern coding techniques (e.g. React Hooks)
- will use a framework of your choice (React is preferred)

The exercise has existing code which you should copy and paste into your
editor of choice. The given code is a starting place, meant to be added to,
but feel free to replace or remove code if you think you can improve your
solution. Feel free to add extras. The exercise is meant to evaluate technical skills,
not design. Be creative!

For the requirements of the exercise see the description in the code snippet
in index.html.
