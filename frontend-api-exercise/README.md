Below is an exercise to be completed before your interview using whatever
resources you would like (e.g. codepen, github, etc.). 

In your interview you will discuss your solution and your process.

The solution: 

- should run with no errors
- should be well commented 
- and the rendered elements should look professional

The exercise has existing code which you should copy and paste into your
editor of choice. The given code is a starting place, meant to be added to,
but feel free to replace or remove code if you think you can improve your
solution. Feel free to add extras.  Be creative!

For the requirements of the exercise see the description in the code snippet
